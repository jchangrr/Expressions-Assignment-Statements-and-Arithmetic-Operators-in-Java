Exercise 1: Write a Java program that displays the result of the following formula where X and Y are non-zero values entered by users:
(3 + 4x)/5 - 10(y-5)/x + 9(4/x + (9+x)/y)

Exercise 2: Write a Java program to declare and print two integer variables, one float variable, and one string variable and assign 20, 3, 14.6, and "Hello 101 " to them respectively.

Exercise 3: If $1 Dollar equals to 0.9 Euros
Write a java program that ask the user to enter the amount they need to convert.
Then the program will ask the user to enter either 1 or 2.
If the user enters 1, then you convert the values from dollars to euros.
If the user enters 2, then you convert the values from euros to dollars.
The output of the program is a single line:
You entered xx.xx in “Dollars/Euros” based on the user and they are equal to zz.zz (Euros/Dollars).

Exercise 4: Write a program that predicts the score needed on a final exam to achieve a desired grade in a course. The program should interact with the user as follows:
Enter desired grade> B
Enter minimum average required> 79.5
Enter current average in course> 74.6
Enter how much the final count as a percentage of the course grade> 25
You need a score of 94.2 on the final to get B

Exercise 5: Write a program that calculates the addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and the remainder of two numbers (Integers) being entered by the user.
Data Requirements:
Problem input:
X = first number
Y = second number

Problem output:
Sum of x and y
Difference of x and y
Quotient of x and y
Product of x and y
Remainder of x and y
